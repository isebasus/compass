# üìúÔ∏è Compass [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/isebasus/Archive/blob/master/LICENSE)
A silly lightweight Minecraft server API used for server statuses.

# API Calls
The following describes Compass's API calls.

### Initialization 
This API call is used to initialize a server to the API, so that way calls to ping can be cached.

``/v1/init``

The response should contain the payload:
```
hostname: String,
port: Int,
protocolVersion: Int,
serverVersion: String,
maxPlayerCount: Int,
playerCount: List,
description: String,
favicon: String,
ping: Long,
averagePing: List,
numberOfPings: Long,
status: ServerError
lastClientPing: Long
```

### Ping
This API call is used after initialization, and the call will now use the API cache. The response will also contain a smaller payload. 

``/v1/ping``

The response should contain the payload: 
```
playerCount: List,
ping: Long,
averagePing: List,
numberOfPings: Long,
status: ServerError
```
